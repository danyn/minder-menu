1. hard code a metaobject type in constants 
    - also create the definition.

2. Check to see if that metaobject type exists by 
https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/queries/metaobjectDefinitionByType

if it doesn't:

   create it:
   https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/mutations/metaobjectDefinitionCreate

   add a first with entry data:
   https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/mutations/metaobjectCreate

this means at this point if it does exist it has entry data

Get the a list of all metaobjects of this type:
https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/queries/metaobjects

  - if its a single it should be at array[0]
   or you could get a single metaobject by its handle (type+instanceSuffix) :
   https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2023-10/queries/metaobjectByHandle

  - there are many its a list
  - this way no id's need to be store
  - it just uses the constant value stored as they metafield type
  - which is common name to all stores and unique within each store.
