Shopify says that you cannot a release an app that targets one theme.
Nor can a theme directly use data produced by an app outside of app blocks etc..

So my plan is to release an app that generates some very simple metaobject powered pages and a few simple theme enhancments like a canonical breadrumb.

Once the app is live it will be easier to push theme updates without being scrutinized

At this point the app will push some app blocks and features that do target specific themes.
The app overall supports all themes with its main features
but a few of the features target a specific theme (Dawn).
The reason is that dawn is the only open source theme so doing something like replacing the header element would be sketchy if one can't test it across versions and see everything through time.

So the App will just do a few things:
- Assist in the creation of metobject powered pages by creating a structure for the user
- provide some app blocks if the user wants them to consume the structure
- provide theme enhancements that work in any theme as an app block
    - canonical breadcrumb
    - one more....
- For Dawn it will provide a header
    - upload your own cart icon and other icons for header functionality
    - choose between many header layouts
    - have a full featured mega menu for desktops

That's all 
if you charge 6.99 usd and you got 600 installs that would be 4200 per month right. 50k per year that is the goal its not great at all but its something for a resume that would be profitable as well. 

Targeting the default theme is why I think these foot in the door tactics are worth while.
